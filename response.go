Product Configurator Service

 The Product Configurator Service is a versatile platform designed to manage dynamic product configurations.  It enables the creation, updating, and management of product configurations through steps, options, and dependencies,  ensuring granular control over customization.  ## Core Components 1. **Configurators**    - Create and manage configurators linked to products.    - Support for configurator states (`ACTIVE`, `DRAFT`, etc.) and versioning.  2. **Steps**    - Define logical sequences to guide users through the configuration process.    - Include localized labels, descriptions, and selection rules.  3. **Options**    - Add and manage options available for each step.    - Support for visual content (`Swatch`) and configurable quantities.  4. **Dependencies**    - Create rules between options and steps to control dynamic interactions.    - Manage complex conditions across configurations.  5. **Matrices**    - Use matrices to handle prices, weights, and other properties.    - Support for dynamic customization based on user selections.  6. **Properties**    - Add custom attributes and properties to configurators.  7. **Configuration Management**    - Retrieve available or user-specific configurations.    - Create optimized configurations to enhance the user experience.  ## Key Features - **Security**: Authenticate every request with JWT, ensuring safety and reliability. - **Flexibility**: Bulk operations (create, update, delete) for steps, options, and dependencies. - **Scalability**: Suitable for large volumes of configurations and complex personalization scenarios. - **Backward Compatibility**: Version management to minimize the impact of changes on existing clients.
